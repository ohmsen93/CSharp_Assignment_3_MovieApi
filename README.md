# Description
Using Code first principle, the ASP.Net Core Web API creates a database called movieDbDTO which consist of 3 tables: Characters, Movies & Franchises as well as a linking table between Movie and Character because of their many to many relation. This Database can then be manipulated using the REST Controllers CRUD calls.
